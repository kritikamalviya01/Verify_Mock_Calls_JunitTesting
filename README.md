Mockito is a popular mocking framework for Java. Let's delve into Mockito's verification methods and their usage.

Mockito Verification Methods:

1. Basic Verification:

  •	Verifying that a method was called:
    		Mockito.verify(mockObject).methodName();

2. Verification with Arguments:

  •	Verifying that a method was called with specific arguments:
     	 	Mockito.verify(mockObject).methodName("arg1", "arg2");

3. Verification with Times:

  •	Verifying that a method was called a specific number of times:
        // Exactly 2 times
        Mockito.verify(mockObject, Mockito.times(2)).methodName();
        
        // At least 3 times
        Mockito.verify(mockObject, Mockito.atLeast(3)).methodName();
        
        // At most 4 times
        Mockito.verify(mockObject, Mockito.atMost(4)).methodName();

4. Verification of No Interaction:

  •	Verifying that no other method was called on the mock object:
        Mockito.verifyNoMoreInteractions(mockObject);

5. Verification with Timeout:

  •	Verifying that a method was called within a specified timeout:
        Mockito.verify(mockObject, Mockito.timeout(100)).methodName();

6. Verification in Order:

  •	Verifying that methods were called in a specific order:
        InOrder inOrder = Mockito.inOrder(mockObject);
        inOrder.verify(mockObject).firstMethod();
        inOrder.verify(mockObject).secondMethod();

7. Verification with Argument Matchers:

  •	Using argument matchers for flexible verification:
        Mockito.verify(mockObject).methodName(Mockito.anyString());
        Mockito.verify(mockObject).methodName(Mockito.eq(expectedValue));
